# Sustainable Development Practices

> For rule creation guidelines, see [Rule Creation Framework](.cursor/rules/rul3s.mdc)

When helping develop solutions that will grow over time:

1. Recommend simple documentation practices from the beginning
2. Suggest implementing basic automated tests early to prevent regression
3. Recommend consistent code style and organization patterns
4. Suggest modular architecture that allows for future expansion
5. Recommend implementing proper error handling and logging from the start
6. Suggest version control best practices (branching strategies, commit messages)
7. Recommend considering accessibility early rather than retrofitting later
8. Suggest implementing basic security practices from the beginning
9. Recommend planning for internationalization even if initially only one language is needed
10. Suggest implementing basic monitoring and observability
11. Recommend regular dependency updates and maintenance practices
12. Suggest creating reusable components and utilities to reduce duplication
